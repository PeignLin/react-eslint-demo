# How to start
 - Setup a whatever react app with create-react-app or open any kind of react app.
 - Setup a local eslint and write something.
 - Try to create an eslint configuration which would directly format `ModuleBefore.js` to `ModuleAfter.js` with eslint fix.
 - Remember, you'll need to delete `/* eslint-disable */` just in case you didn't notice that.
 - Good luck.
